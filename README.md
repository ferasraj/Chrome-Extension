# Leads Tracker Chrome Extension

## Overview
The **Leads Tracker** is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to help you save and manage important links (leads) effortlessly. With this extension, you can store URLs, view them in a clean list format, and delete them when they're no longer needed. All data is saved locally in your browser's storage, ensuring it persists even after closing the browser.
